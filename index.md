# Swift Style Guide

## Naming

### Conventions

Many programming languages have different conventions for naming. In Swift, strive to use `camalCase` and `PascalCase`.

| Naming Convention | Usage |
|-------------------|-------|
| Single letter (`x`) | In `for` loops |
| Uppercase letter (`X`) 🏝️ | Not recommended |
| camelCase (`thisCamel`) 🐫 | Variable names |
| PascalCase (`CoolType`) | Structs, enums, classes, and actors |
| snake_case (`a_green_snake`) 🐍 | Not reccommended |
| DRAGON_CASE (Snake Case + Capital Letters) (`MY_STORY`) 🐉 | Constants |
